# Modified-Half-UNet-for-Medical-Image-Classification
A modified Half-UNet model for brain tumor classification using MRI scans. This project repurposes the UNet architecture for classification by integrating dense layers at the bottleneck. Built with PyTorch and Albumentations, it demonstrates high accuracy on the Kaggle Brain Tumor Detection dataset.
