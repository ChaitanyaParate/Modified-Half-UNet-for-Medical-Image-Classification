# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using Modified Half-U-Net

This repository presents a **research-oriented implementation** of a modified **Half-U-Net architecture** designed for **binary classification** of brain MRI scans — detecting the presence or absence of tumors.  
Unlike traditional U-Net models that perform segmentation, this model repurposes the encoder (contracting) path of Half U-Net and couples it with a custom fully connected classification head.

## 🚀 Abstract

The Half U-Net architecture has been widely used in biomedical image segmentation due to its encoder–decoder structure. However, for classification tasks, the decoder section becomes redundant and computationally expensive.  
This work proposes a **Half-U-Net** that retains only the **encoder path** of U-Net and integrates a **custom linear classification module**. The model is trained end-to-end on MRI brain scans for tumor detection, achieving high accuracy with efficient computation.

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🧠 **Half-U-Net backbone** — encoder-only U-Net adapted for classification  
- ⚙️ **Dynamic classifier initialization** — input dimensions auto-detected during first forward pass  
- 📉 **Binary classification** (`tumor` / `no tumor`)  
- 🔄 **Augmentation** via Albumentations (rotation, flip, normalization)  
- 🪄 **Adaptive learning rate** using `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler  
- 💾 **Checkpointing** and `.pth` model export for later inference

## 🗂 Dataset

**Dataset:** [Brain Tumor Detection – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection)

The dataset consists of MRI images categorized into:
```
Data/
├── yes/   # MRI images with tumor
└── no/    # MRI images without tumor
```

Each image is resized to `315×315` and normalized to `[0, 1]`.

## 🔬 Research Contribution

This implementation demonstrates that:
- Encoder-only CNNs derived from segmentation networks can effectively perform classification.  
- The **Half-U-Net** retains contextual feature extraction while being lighter and faster than full U-Net.  
- Dynamic linear head initialization ensures architecture flexibility across different input resolutions.
